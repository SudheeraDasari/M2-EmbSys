## Sensor
#  4x4 Matrix Keypad
  The 4x4 Matrix Keypad interfaced is to take the input from the person. We can enter the preset password to test the validity of the password. If the password is valid then,     the door lock will be unlocked. If invalid, the door lock will continue to be locked. The 4x4 Matrix Keypad includes 4 rows and 4 columns. There is a transfer that connects     every row and column. In our project We will use only the numeric between 0-9 keys along with * to change the password.

# ACTUATOR

## LCD Display:
    Display each and every value we enter in our keypad.

 ## Servo Motor:
 
   Helps in opening and closing our doors.

## Arduino Uno

This microcontroller depends on the ATmega328P. There are all out of 20 pins (0-19) out of which 6 are simple information sources, 14 are computerized input yield pins(6 pins give PWM voltage) which can like be utilized as broadly useful pins, a ceramic resonator of recurrence 16 MHz, a USB association, a force jack and a reset button. It has a working voltage of 5V. It contains all that expected to help a microcontroller.
