## Description

## Light sensor (Push Buttons):

Light sensor is used to sense amount of light. There are many light sensors available in market but Light dependent resistor (LDR) is used as a light sensor. Because it is cheap in price, easily available in market and can be easily interfaced with microcontroller to sense intensity of light. LDR have property to change its resistance according to intensity of light. If light is high, LDR will have low resistance and if light is low, LDR will have high resistance. So microcontroller can easily read this resistance in the form of voltage and which can be back converted into proportional value of light. In this I am using push buttons gor light sensor.

# ACTUATOR

## Relay interfacing with microcontroller :

As I have already mentioned above that microcontroller is used to analyze intensity of light and to generate control signal which in turn on or off transistor which in turn energize relay to turn street light on or off. NPN transistor is used as a switch and resistor at the base of transistor is used as current limiting resistor. Diode is used to avoid back emf voltage which may produce sparking across relay.

## MICROCONTROLLER

PIC161F877A microcontroller is used interfaced with light sensor to sense amount of light available. Control signal is generated with the help of pic16f877a microcontroller after analyzing amount of light. Control signal generated by pic microcontroller is used to turn on transistor which in turn energize the relay coil and relay turn on the street light.
