# AUTOMATIC CONTROL OF STREET LIGHTS

## ABSTRACT

 Automatic control of street lights is deigned to turn on and turn of street lights automatically. This project check the amount of light. If light is 80 percent available, i automatically turn off street lights. But if amount of light is less than 80 percent, this project will automatically turn on street lights. one can also adjust it according to    its requirement.The circuit uses a light sensor to sense the light. It doesn’t need operator maintenance and initial installation setup.Light sensors and micro controller, relay  are the main components of the project. Light sensor is like our eye which detect the presence of an object and Relay is an electromagnetic device which is used to isolate two
circuits electrically and connect them magnetically.

## INTRODUCTION

The Street lights are the major requirements in today’s life for safety purposes and avoiding accidents during night. Providing street lighting is one of the most important and expensive responsibilities of a city.Street lighting is a particularly critical concern for public authorities in developing countries.Despite that in today’s busy lifestyle no one bothers to switch it OFF/ON when not required.

## LITERATURE SURVEY

We need to save or conserve energy because most of the energy sources we depend on, like coal and natural gas can’t be replaced. Once we use them up, they’re gone forever. Saving power is very important, instead of using the power in unnecessary times it should be switched off. In any city STREET LIGHT is one of the major power consuming factors. Most of the time we see street lights are ON even after sunrise thus wasting lot of energy. Over here we are avoiding the problem by having an automatic system which turns ON OFF the street lights at given time or when the ambient light falls below a specific. intensity. Each controller has an LDR which is used to detect the ambient light. If the ambient light is below a specific value the lights are turned ON. A light dependent sensors is interfaced to PIC161F877A microcontroller it is used to track the sun light and when the sensors goes dark the led will be made on and when the sensor founds light the led will be made OFF. 

## High Level Requirements

* To provide lighting to the streets such that minimum possible power is consumed during nights.
* To manage the traffic flow smoothly and efficiently during night.
* To develop the simulation  of control unit.
*  To test and validate the designed system.

## Low Level Requirement

* According to the values of LDR to control the lights.
* The microcontroller should be loaded with code and activate the lights when sensor activated.
